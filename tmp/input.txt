People that write articles like this always confuse me: &gt;for years apple have been confusing us by not buying things they clearly should be buying  How and why does this guy think he has a better business model than one of the richest companies in the world? 
Great gaming developers - yeah, Apple already has plenty, especially with big console-heavy developers like EA also developing for iOS, but it certainly wouldn't hurt.   At the moment, [Apple is basically Nintendo's biggest competition](http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/10/nintendo-apple-is-enemy-of-the-future/), and Nintendo is in a pretty bad position with their 3DS failure, so I wouldn't see why Apple would necessarily want to buy them when they're [growing faster than them in gaming](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/07/27/electronic_arts_apple_ipad_our_fastest_growing_platform_for_gaming.html) anyway.  Nintendo still stands pretty well as it is, but an acquisition by Apple would be pretty fantastic for the iPhone, especially the iPad, and perhaps even the Apple TV.  I seriously doubt it will ever happen, but it would be pretty cool.
I read it as a sarcastic phrase - as in journalists always thinking they know better than Apple, not his personal opinion.

Nintendo's best developers are Nintendo.
Your ass is your mouth.  I didn't say anything about day/night cycles and sunlight you moron.  Just the minor lighting from a fucking LCD screen.
I have lion at home, sn at work.  I can screen share but I've only done it once or twice, concerned about crashes.  (Work outer runs a security system, if it crashes I need to drive over and restart it.)
it is built into the os, I am quite sure.
try adding vitamin D to that.  One cam license is free.
